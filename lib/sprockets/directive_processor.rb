  # The `DirectiveProcessor` is responsible for parsing and evaluating
  # directive comments in a source file.
  #
  # A directive comment starts with a comment prefix, followed by an "=",
  # then the directive name, then any arguments.
  #
  #     // JavaScript
  #     //= require "foo"
  #
  #     # CoffeeScript
  #     #= require "bar"
  #
  #     /* CSS
  #      *= require "baz"
  #      */
  #
  # This makes it possible to disable or modify the processor to do whatever
  # you'd like. You could add your own custom directives or invent your own
  # directive syntax.
  #
  # `Environment#processors` includes `DirectiveProcessor` by default.
  #
  # To remove the processor entirely:
  #
  #     env.unregister_processor('text/css', Sprockets::DirectiveProcessor)
  #     env.unregister_processor('application/javascript', Sprockets::DirectiveProcessor)
  #
  # Then inject your own preprocessor:
  #
  #     env.register_processor('text/css', MyProcessor)
  #

    # of code will not be processed.
