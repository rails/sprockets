### Expected behavior

Tell us what should happen

### Actual behavior

Tell us what happens instead

### System configuration

- Sprockets version
- Ruby version

### Example App

Please provide an [example app](https://www.codetriage.com/example_app) that reproduces the problem. This will save maintainers time so they can spend it fixing your issues instead of trying to build a reproduction case from sparse instructions.

To create an example app, make an application locally that uses your same version of Sprockets. Add files to reproduce the problem. Once you've reproduced the problem add instructions on how to run your example app to a README.md file. Then commit everything to git and push to a new project on github. Once you've pushed your app add a link back to this issue.
